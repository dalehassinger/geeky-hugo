[{"categories":["vExpert"],"contents":"vExpert 2020 - 2022   I am very proud to be part of the VMware vExpert program. This is the third year that I was accepted into the program. One part of the vExpert program that I think is great is that the program recognizes people for sharing their knowledge and \u0026ldquo;Giving Back\u0026rdquo;. A person selected into the vExpert programs is someone that likes to share, wants to make themselves and everyone around them smarter.\nI think that 2021 was a one of my most productive years and one that I advanced my own personal knowledge the most.\nHighlights of 2021 to get accepted into the vExpert Program:  VMworld 2021 session (Presentation): Manage Windows Workloads Through vRealize Automation SaltStack Config [MCL1895] SaltConf21 session (Presentation): Managing Windows with SaltStack Config (6) of my personal Blogs were shared by the VMware “vExpert Cloud Management Community” on the Vmware Blog Web Site. I did several vRealize Automation Presentations at VMware HVC (Healthcare Virtualization Community) Events. PowerBlock Customer Showcase - VM “Right Sizing” I did a IDC interview for VMware on Automation that will be released in 2022. I did a VMware Customer Profile Interview that will be released in 2022. I shared a vRealize Operations “Right Sizing” Dashboard on the code.vmware.com web site.   What is the VMware vExpert Program? Program Overview The VMware vExpert program is VMware\u0026rsquo;s global evangelism and advocacy program. The program is designed to put VMware\u0026rsquo;s marketing resources towards your advocacy efforts. Promotion of your articles, exposure at our global events, co-op advertising, traffic analysis, and early access to beta programs and VMware\u0026rsquo;s roadmap. The awards are for individuals, not companies, and last for one year. Employees of both customers and partners can receive the awards. In the application, we consider various community activities from the previous year as well as the current year\u0026rsquo;s (only for 2nd half applications) activities in determining who gets awards. We look to see that not only were you active but are still active in the path you chose to apply for.\nCriteria If you are interested in becoming a vExpert the criteria is simple. We are looking for IT Professionals who are sharing their VMware knowledge and contributing that back to the community. The term \u0026ldquo;giving back\u0026rdquo; is defined as going above and beyond your day job. There are several ways to share your knowledge and engage with the community. Some of those activities are blogging, book authoring, magazine articles, CloudCred task writing, active in Facebook groups, forum (VMTN as well as other non VMware) platforms, public speaking, VMUG leadership, videos and so on.\n Thanks: I have worked with a great group of people at VMware, past and present.

I am using VMware vRealize Automation and SaltStack Config to complete server builds, software installs, schedule VM snap shots, Microsoft 365 automation, Citrix Management, Automate Data Center Flips, Server Decommissions, and many other Day 2 processes… For monitoring I use vRealize Operations for the “Single Pane of Glass” experience. I also use vRealize Log Insight for logging and LCM (Life Cycle Manager) for installing all the vRealize Products.\nAlmost all the code I write to complete the Automation that I create is done with PowerShell. The reason I choose to use PowerShell is because to do Automation with VMware products they have released their product PowerCLI, which is built on top of PowerShell. There hasn’t been anything that I wanted to Automate that I haven’t been able to do with PowerShell. To do remote Citrix management also works very well using PowerShell.\nI have also started to do Automation with Azure. I am using PowerShell to create VMs and SaltStack Config to complete the configuration management, install software and maintain state.\n I have learned a lot from the vCommunity, Powershell and PowerCLI web sites. I want to use this blog as a way for me to give back. If one person finds anything I post helpful, I will consider my efforts successful.\nThe code that I have shared I use with vRealize Automation Cloud Templates/Catalog Items and everyday VMware Admin functions. Everyday I learn something new. If I think it should be shared I will write a blog about it. Check back often to see what I am doing next.\n ","date":"January 1, 1","image":"https://dalehassinger.github.io/geeky-hugo/images/author_hu37ae56563c66f39bdbf8622184166817_4018496_650x0_resize_box_3.png","permalink":"/geeky-hugo/about/","title":"About Dale Hassinger"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","date":"January 1, 1","image":"https://dalehassinger.github.io/geeky-hugo/images/author_hu37ae56563c66f39bdbf8622184166817_4018496_650x0_resize_box_3.png","permalink":"/geeky-hugo/contact/","title":"Contact Page"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Privacy Policy Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
