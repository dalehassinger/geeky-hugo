This is the third year that I was accepted into the program. One part of the vExpert program that I think is great is that the program recognizes people for sharing their knowledge and \u0026ldquo;Giving Back\u0026rdquo;. A person selected into the vExpert programs is someone that likes to share, wants to make themselves and everyone around them smarter.\nI think that 2021 was one of my most productive years and one that I advanced my own personal knowledge the most.\nHighlights of 2021 to get accepted into the vExpert Program:  VMworld 2021 session (Presentation): Manage Windows Workloads Through vRealize Automation SaltStack Config [MCL1895] SaltConf21 session (Presentation): Managing Windows with SaltStack Config (6) of my personal Blogs were shared by the VMware “vExpert Cloud Management Community” on the Vmware Blog Web Site. I did several vRealize Automation Presentations at VMware HVC (Healthcare Virtualization Community) Events. PowerBlock Customer Showcase - VM “Right Sizing” I did a IDC interview for VMware on Automation that will be released in 2022. I did a VMware Customer Profile Interview that will be released in 2022. I shared a vRealize Operations “Right Sizing” Dashboard on the code.vmware.com web site.   What is the VMware vExpert Program? Program Overview The VMware vExpert program is VMware\u0026rsquo;s global evangelism and advocacy program. The program is designed to put VMware\u0026rsquo;s marketing resources towards your advocacy efforts. Promotion of your articles, exposure at our global events, co-op advertising, traffic analysis, and early access to beta programs and VMware\u0026rsquo;s roadmap. The awards are for individuals, not companies, and last for one year. Employees of both customers and partners can receive the awards. In the application, we consider various community activities from the previous year as well as the current year\u0026rsquo;s (only for 2nd half applications) activities in determining who gets awards. We look to see that not only were you active but are still active in the path you chose to apply for.\nCriteria If you are interested in becoming a vExpert the criteria is simple. We are looking for IT Professionals who are sharing their VMware knowledge and contributing that back to the community. The term \u0026ldquo;giving back\u0026rdquo; is defined as going above and beyond your day job. There are several ways to share your knowledge and engage with the community. Some of those activities are blogging, book authoring, magazine articles, CloudCred task writing, active in Facebook groups, forum (VMTN as well as other non VMware) platforms, public speaking, VMUG leadership, videos and so on.\n Thanks: I have worked with a great group of people at VMware, past and present. I would like to thank the following people for all their support in no particular order: Steve Leiberson, Karl Hauck, Cosmin Trif, Brock Peterson, Kevin Holland, Daniel Thomas, Marcus Roberts, Paul Schlosser.\nSpecial Thanks to David Kruse for getting me started with vRA.\nSpecial Thanks to some past co-workers, SEs, TAMs, HVC Members that I learned a lot from: Kirk Shaffer, Robert Mitchell, Dan Grove, Steve Holmes, Steve Pittenger, Anton Wesztergom (Opened my eyes to vRA Day 2).\nList of Bloggers that I follow and have learned a lot by them \u0026ldquo;Giving Back\u0026rdquo;: Cody De Arkland, Luc Dekens, Kyle Ruddy, William Lam, Nathen Bennett, Vince Wood, Alan Renouf.\nSpecial Thanks to the person that gave me my first Job in IT: David Cornelius\nand anyone else that helped me in my journey called my career\u0026hellip;\n I have learned a lot from the vCommunity. I want to use this blog as a way for me to \u0026ldquo;give back\u0026rdquo;. If one person finds anything I post helpful I will consider my efforts successful. I am always open to talking to any person, group or organization about what I do with VMware products. Please reach out to me if you ever want to have a discussion.\nEmail: Dale.Hassinger@vCrocs.info\nLocation: Dillsburg, PA\n\u0026ldquo;9 - 5 pays the bills, 5 - 10 advances your career\u0026rdquo; ","date":"February 22, 2022","image":"https://dalehassinger.github.io/geeky-hugo/images/post/vexpert-2022-01_huea633dfc62497ad674470427f21ef8c9_70292_650x0_resize_box_3.png","permalink":"/geeky-hugo/blog/vexpert-2022/","title":"vExpert 2022"},{"categories":["SaltStack Config"],"contents":" Part 8: Pouring the salt grains    My previous posts about grain data were to show how to add minion grain data during the creation of a new server with vRA using PowerShell.

Add the script to the SaltStack Config File Manager. Use salt-call to run salt.functions locally on a minion. See screen shot and my code examples below. Create a SaltStack Config Job to execute the PowerShell Script remotely on the minion. See Screen Shot. Create a SaltStack Config Schedule to run the job that you create. The job can run every day, once a week, every 4 hours. Whatever makes sense for your use case. See Screen Shot.   If you want to run a script locally on a minion and use salt functions that is where you use the salt-call command. After you learn the salt-functions and are logged into a Windows Server locally, you can still use salt commands by using salt-call.\n# --- example code salt-call --version salt-call test.ping # --- Show Disk Usage salt-call disk.usage # --- Show Installed Features|Roles salt-call win_servermanager.list_installed # --- Show Installed Sofwtare salt-call pkg.list_pkgs Link to salt-call Documentation\n Step 1 - Add script to SaltStack Config File Manager: See code examples below to add Windows Server Features|Roles, Installed Software, and Runnings Services as grain data.\nClick Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\nStep 2 - Create SaltStack Config Job:  Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\nStep 3 - Create SaltStack Config Schedule:  Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\n Code Examples: - Add Windows Features | Roles as grain data: \u0026lt;# .SYNOPSISThis Script is used to Get Windows Servers Features and add as Grain Data .DESCRIPTIONWindows Servers Features .PARAMETERNo Parameters .INPUTSNo inputs .OUTPUTSsalt grain data .NOTESVersion: 1.00 Author: Dale Hassinger Creation Date: 04/20/2022 Purpose/Change: Initial script development Revisions: .EXAMPLEN/A #\u0026gt;

I spent the entire year working from home and I find myself to be more productive when WFH. My wife and I moved into a different home and I now have a dedicated office area on the 2nd floor away from anyone else. I still share my office with Belle (Rescue Dog adopted in 2020 before covid) everyday and she loves the fenced in back yard that she can run around in without a leash.\nIn 2021 I started living the \u0026ldquo;Salt Life\u0026rdquo;. In July I installed SaltStack Config for the first time and started taking a serious look at Salt. I went from zero to doing a presentation about SaltStack at VMworld in October and another presentation at SaltConf21 in November. Getting a session selected for VMworld was a career \u0026ldquo;Bucket List\u0026rdquo; for me.\nAfter creating a vRealize Operations Dashboard on \u0026ldquo;Right Sizing\u0026rdquo; that I use in production, my vRealize Account Executive setup a meeting for me to meet Iwan \u0026lsquo;e1\u0026rsquo; Rahabok who is the co-creator of the book \u0026ldquo;Operationalize Your World\u0026rdquo;.

I use PowerShell for a lot of Automation, Windows Server and Linux Server. When working with VMware vRealize SaltStack Config I constantly found myself going to the CLI to test and learn how the salt functions work. In the Part 5 Blog of this series I showed how I am using the PowerShell module POSH-SSH to connect to the VMware vRealize SaltStack Config Server to run salt commands remotely. So I started writing some PowerShell functions to run remote salt commands on the Salt Master. The end goal might be to turn this script into a Salt PowerShell Module. To start it will only have the functions that I find myself using the most. I could turn this into a community Github Project and see if there would be any interest. If anyone reading this blog post has any interest please reach out to me. (Dale.Hassinger@vCROCS.info)\nMy goal is to make all these PowerShell Salt functions work with VMware vRealize SaltStack Config like PowerCLI works with VMware vCenter. Use same verb/noun terminology. I use PowerCLI for all my VMware Automation. Works awesome! So to create these PowerShell Functions to work with my existing automation scripts is a win win in my book.\nNormally I will use a Products APIs to do all these types of processes. I looked at VMware vRealize SaltStack Config APIs and to the best of my knowledge I can not use them like I can the PS functions that I created. That may change in a future release of VMware vRealize SaltStack Config.

Using the PowerShell Functions above as a Windows admin makes it very easy to add this code to existing scripts and use the Power of SaltStack without completely changing your processes. Creating a SSH Connection to a remote Salt Master and running commands works well in a \u0026ldquo;Zero Trust\u0026rdquo; environment. With NSX-T all you need to do is setup allow rules between the minions and the master on ports 4505,4506.

I have been spending more time with VMware vRealize SaltStack Config and I have learned some better ways to do some of the processes that I have talked about already. My goal to to learn and use the built-in functions that are already in the product. I found that using the salt functions require less coding and better logging. First example of changing how I am going to use VMware vRealize SaltStack Config. When I first started looking at grains I thought I would edit the grains file with PowerShell and add the grains content to the file. What I did worked but I think I learned a better way. There is a function grains.append that will append grains data to the grains file on the minion. This works much better and when I run a job to add grains information it is listed in Activity Completed within VMware vRealize SaltStack Config. I like to be able to see when changes are made by the jobs that are run.\nThe code that I have listed below to get vCenter TAGs assigned to a VM and add the information to the minion is using PowerShell. To use this script you MUST install the PowerShell Module POSH-SSH. The process I am showing connects to a vCenter, creates a SSH Connection to the Salt Server, gets all assigned vCenter TAGs for a VM, , runs salt commands to add grain information to the grains file of a minion, and then runs a minion grains sync. This concept can be used for a lot of different systems. If you want to add NSX-T Security TAGs as grain information (Thanks Karl Hauck for this idea), AD (Active Directory) OU of the Windows Server, or anything you think would be useful to Target minions within VMware vRealize SaltStack Config.\nI really like the idea of using POSH-SSH to make the SSH connection to the Salt Master Server and running commands. I do a lot of Automation within vRA (vRealize Automation) with PowerShell and I can use this same concept to use VMware vRealize SaltStack Config to complete the processes that need run. I can also create Catalog items within vRA that you can make available to APP Teams to use. The Catalog item could be running salt jobs in VMware vRealize SaltStack Config. Cool Stuff!\n  Grains File: This is what I learned about salt grains when using with a Windows OS.\n The default location of the grains file is in directory \u0026ldquo;C:\\salt\\conf\u0026quot;. The grains file is named grains with no extension.  Example grains file: NSXSecurityTAGs: - vCROCS.Apps.VMware.SaltStack.Minion vCenterTAGs: - TAG-VM-WebServer - TAG-VM-vCROCS - TAG-App-Hugo  \u0026ldquo;Grain Name\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;The value of the grain\u0026rdquo;. In my example I wanted the grain to be named \u0026ldquo;vCenterTags\u0026rdquo; and the values will be the vCenter TAG names \u0026ldquo;TAG-VM-vCROCS, TAG-VM-WebServer, TAG-App-Hugo\u0026rdquo;. I have (3) vCenter TAGs assigned to this VM. I will be able to create a SaltStack Config Target based on any of the TAGs. I like the formatting that is used for the grains file by using the function grains.append.   SaltStack Config Targets: When I add the vCenter TAG information to the grains file I am then able to create SaltStack Config Targets based on the grain \u0026ldquo;vCenterTags\u0026rdquo;.\nSaltStack Config Targets:  Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\nSaltStack Config Target Definition:  Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\nHow to add the vCenter TAGs to the grains file on all your VMs in SaltStack Config:\nGet the VM Names and All Assigned vCenter TAGs\nPowerShell Script: # ----- [ SSH SaltStack Config Server - Add vCenter TAGs to Minion Grains ] -------------------------- # Connect to vCenter before running this code # Define your Credentials # SSH to SaltStack Server - MUST HAVE POSH-SSH PowerShell Module Installed  New-SSHSession -ComputerName \u0026#39;SaltServer.vCROCS.info\u0026#39; # Test SSH Connection $CheckSSHConnection = Get-SSHSession -SessionId 0 $CheckSSHConnection.Connected $vmNames = Get-VM -Name vCROCS-VM-* $vmNames = $vmNames | Sort-Object Name foreach($vmName in $VMNames){ $vmName.Name #Get VM Tag(s) $VMTags = Get-TagAssignment -Entity $vmName.Name $VMTags.Tag.Name foreach($vmTAG in $VMTags.Tag.Name){ $sshCommand = \u0026#39;salt \u0026#34;\u0026#39; + $vmName.Name + \u0026#39;\u0026#34; grains.append vCenterTAGs \u0026#34;\u0026#39; + $vmTAG + \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39; $results = Invoke-SSHCommand -SessionId 0 -Command $sshCommand } # End Foreach # Sync Grains after adding new grain information $sshCommand = \u0026#39;salt \u0026#34;\u0026#39; + $vmName.Name + \u0026#39;\u0026#34; saltutil.sync_grains\u0026#39; $results = Invoke-SSHCommand -SessionId 0 -Command $sshCommand } # End Foreach # ----- [ Terminate SSH Session ] ----------------------------- Remove-SSHSession -SessionId 0\nLessons Learned:  Adding the POSH-SSH PowerShell module so you can create a SSH connection to the salt master opens up a lot of possibilities for your PowerShell Automation as a Windows Server Admin. Grains are a good way to create SaltStack Config Targets. Allows you to group VMs together the same way you can in vCenter. The Grains file is basically a Database that can be any information that you want to show about your VMs. In this Blog post I am adding vCenter TAGs to the minions but the information could be anything that helps you target VMs. If the default list of grains OOTB doesn\u0026rsquo;t show the information you want to see, you can easily add your own gains with a little bit of code.

So the concept of using salt to copy files to minions, use the files to make changes and then delete the files when processes are complete works well in a zero trust environment.\nJob to copy csv file to minions:  Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\n Step 4: Run Script on minion After I copy the csv file to the minion I run a script to create/update the grains files.\nJob to run a PowerShell Script to create/update the grains file:  Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\nExample PowerShell Code to create/update grains file on a minion:\n# ----- [ Start Create Grain File with TAGs Assigned ] ---------------------------- $allvmstaginfoFile = \u0026#34;C:\\vCROCS\\allvmstaginfo.csv\u0026#34; $grainTagInfo = Import-Csv $allvmstaginfoFile $vmName = hostname $grainsFile = \u0026#34;C:\\salt\\conf\\grains\u0026#34; if (Test-Path $grainsFile) { # Remove existing vCenter Tags $grainsContent = Get-Content $grainsFile $grainsContent = $grainsContent | Where-Object {$_ -notmatch \u0026#34;vCenterTags:\u0026#34;} # If Only grain is vCenter Tags then Delete the grains file and re-create if(!$grainsContent){ Remove-Item -Path $grainsFile New-Item $grainsFile -ItemType File } # End If else{ $grainsContent | Set-Content $grainsFile -Force } # End Else #Get VM Tag(s) $grainfileinfo = $grainTagInfo | Where-Object {$_.VM -eq $vmName} $VMTagInfo = \u0026#39;vCenterTags: \u0026#39; + $grainfileinfo.TAGs Add-Content $grainsFile $VMTagInfo -Force } # End If else{ # Create grains file New-Item $grainsFile -ItemType File #Get VM Tag(s) $grainfileinfo = $grainTagInfo | Where-Object {$_.VM -eq $vmName} # Define Tags String $VMTagInfo = \u0026#39;vCenterTags: \u0026#39; + $grainfileinfo.TAGs # Add Tags to grains file Add-Content $grainsFile $VMTagInfo -Force } # End else # ----- [ End Create Grain File with TAGs Assigned ] ----------------------------\n Step 5: Run job to do a sync_grains Anytime you make any changes to the grains file you should run the function saltutil.sync_grains to update the SaltStack Config Server immediately.\nJob to run sync of the minion grains information:  Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\n SaltStack Config Orchestration: Job to Orchestrate all the steps:  Copy file to minion.

Allows you to group VMs together the same way you can in vCenter. The Grains file is basically a Database that can be any information that you want to show about your VMs. In this Blog post I am adding vCenter TAGs to the minions but the information could be anything that helps you target VMs. If the default list of grains OOTB doesn\u0026rsquo;t show the information you want to see, you can easily add your own gains with a little bit of code.

How do I NOT allow a Server Admin to login into the server and manually start the service? This is where beacons and reactors work with minion configurations that you want to make permanent. This is the configuration Management Part of Salt Stack. To always make sure a Windows Service is stopped I created a beacon.conf file.

Here are some updates on my journey with SaltStack as a Windows Server Admin.   Auto-Accept new minions: I wanted new Windows Server builds (minions) to be auto accepted into SaltStack Config instead of someone manually approving new minions. To do this you need to have a reactor.conf file. I created the file in SaltStack Config File Server in base/reactor/reactor.conf (See Code below). You also need to create a reactor.conf file in /etc/salt/master.d on the salt master. I use vi to create and edit the reactor.conf file. Anytime you make changes to the /etc/salt/master.d/reactor.conf file you need to restart the salt-master service.\nIn addition to the reactor file you need to create a state file. I located the file in /reactor/accept-key.sls (See Code below). I specified what the name of the new server starts with so that not all new minions get auto accepted. If the Naming Standard that I use is not what the new Server is named it will not be auto accepted. This is one way to have some rules on which new Servers are auto accepted.\n Reactor File: base/reactor/reactor.conf reactor: - \u0026#39;salt/auth\u0026#39;: # React to a new minion - salt://reactor/accept-key.sls # Run this state to auto accept new minion Location of the Reactor File:  Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\n State File: base/reactor/accept-key.sls {% if \u0026#39;act\u0026#39; in data and data[\u0026#39;act\u0026#39;] == \u0026#39;pend\u0026#39; and data[\u0026#39;id\u0026#39;].startswith(\u0026#39;DBH\u0026#39;) %} minion_add: wheel.key.accept: - args: - match: {{ data[\u0026#39;id\u0026#39;]}} {% elif \u0026#39;act\u0026#39; in data and data[\u0026#39;act\u0026#39;] == \u0026#39;pend\u0026#39; and data[\u0026#39;id\u0026#39;].startswith(\u0026#39;vCROCS\u0026#39;) %} minion_add: wheel.key.accept: - args: - match: {{ data[\u0026#39;id\u0026#39;]}} {% endif %} Location of the State File:  Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\n To restart the salt-master service run this command from the salt-master cli. service salt-master restart To check the status of the salt-master service run this command from the salt-master cli. systemctl status salt-minion.service  Jobs: I think a good way to get Started with SaltStack Config after you have some minions added is to create some Jobs. You can create Jobs in the SaltStack Config UI. Go to Config/Jobs. You can manually run these Jobs on the minions.\nHere are some screen shots of jobs that can be useful. To run a job on a single minion go to minions and find the minion you want to run the job on, Select the minion, Select Run Job, Select the Job you want to run, select Run Now. If you select multiple minions the Job will run on all minions selected.\nThat is where you start to see the True Power of Salt. If you Select one, ten, a hundred or a thousand minions, the time to complete the selected job is very quick. As a Windows Admin and using PowerShell, it would not be as easy to run a script on a 1,000 Servers at the exact same time.\n List of all the Jobs:  Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\n Job to stop the Print Spooler Service:  Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\nThis job I am using a salt function service.stop. Pass the Service name as a argument.\n Job to stop the Print Spooler Service using a PowerShell Command:  Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\nThis job I am using a salt function cmd.run. Pass the PowerShell code and type of cmd as arguments.\n Job to stop and disable the Print Spooler Service using a PowerShell script:  Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\nThis job I am using a salt function cmd.script.

Pass the file source path and destination path as arguments.\n Job to reboot a minion:  Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\nThis job I am using a salt function system.reboot. Pass the wait time to reboot and wait_for_reboot as arguments.\n If you noticed I have some jobs doing the same process but one is using a salt function and one is using a PowerShell command. I wanted to show you how your existing PowerShell skills as a Windows Server Admin can be used in SaltStack Config. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to re-learn everything. Using PowerShell with a job is also very helpful when there is not a salt function to do what you need to accomplish. I have been trying to use the built-in salt functions whenever possible to get more familiar with the product.\nHere is a saying that someone wrote or said that I seen online about salt. When in doubt, command out.\n Lessons Learned:  Auto Accepting Minions is a nice start to using SaltStack Config with new vRealize Automation Server Builds. The new server will get auto accepted and you can then setup a State to install software like the Carbon Black Agent on every new Server. Running a job on a 1,000 Servers is just as easy as running a job on a single server.

This blog is a work in progress on my journey with Salt. I started at **zero** and let's see what I discover as I work towards getting to PROD**. So if this topic is interesting to you, check back often. I wanted to learn one of the server configuration products that are available like Salt, Puppet, Chef, Ansible, etc\u0026hellip; but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure which would be the best choice long term. When VMware purchased SaltStack Config the product to choose became a lot easier for me. SaltStack Config is included with vRealize Suite for licensing and I can call VMware support for help, SaltStack Config became the obvious product to pick.\nI like to show how to use VMware vRealize Products from a Windows Server Admin point of view. I do work with both Windows Servers and Linux Servers but most information you see online with Salt is using Linux Servers. I also do most of my current automation with PowerShell scripts. I do not want to lose all the time invested into the logic with my current PowerShell scripts.\n  I am not going to go thru the process to install SaltStack Config. There is already some very good blogs written on installing SaltStack Config. One item I would recommend with installing Salt-Stack Config is to use VMware vRealize Life Cycle Manager (\u0026ldquo;LCM\u0026rdquo;). LCM makes the process to install SaltStack Config a lot easier. This Blog is assuming you already installed SaltStack Config, now how do I use salt and what do I use salt for.\nInstalling and Configuring SaltStack Config  The first step (minions): After you get a working SaltStack Config Server setup, the first item you need to do is add the salt agent to some \u0026ldquo;Test\u0026rdquo; servers. Servers that have the salt agent installed are called minions. There is the option to not add the salt agent to servers but then you need to use SSH to connect. Windows Servers do not have SSH available as default so you would need to install an SSH server like OpenSSH on your servers. My thoughts are I need to add something for the minions to communicate with the salt-master. Instead of adding OpenSSH to every Windows Server I chose to install and use the salt agent.\nFor testing you can manually install the minion agent on a server to become familiar with how the salt commands work. During the install there are two values you need to enter. The name of the master and the name you want to use for the minion. I did that on my first couple test servers but then I created some PowerShell code to install the salt minion agent. # ----- [ Install minion ] ----------------------------------------------- # Define Username/Password $username = \u0026#39;username@vCROCS.info\u0026#39; # The next line is how to create the encrypted password # Read-Host -Prompt \u0026#34;Enter your password - username\u0026#34; -AsSecureString | ConvertFrom-SecureString | Out-File \u0026#34;C:\\PWkey\\username.key\u0026#34; $password = Get-Content \u0026#34;C:\\PWkey\\username.key\u0026#34; | ConvertTo-SecureString $cred = new-object -typename System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -argumentlist $username, $password # ----- [ This section connects you to vCenter where VM is located ] ----- # Connect to vCenter vCenterName = \u0026#39;vCenter.vCROCS.info\u0026#39; Connect-VIServer $vCenterName -Credential $cred # ----- [ Install Salt Agent ] ------------------------------------------- # Name of Server to install the salt minion agent $vmName = \u0026#39;DBH-217\u0026#39; # Copy the minion agent file to your windows server Copy-VMGuestFile -Source G:\\Salt-Minion-2019.2.4-Py3-AMD64-Setup.exe -Destination \u0026#39;C:\\vCROCS\u0026#39; -VM $vmName -LocalToGuest -GuestCredential $cred # command string to install the Salt Minion Agent $PSText = \u0026#39;C:\\vCROCS\\Salt-Minion-2019.2.4-Py3-AMD64-Setup.exe /S /master=salt /minion-name=\u0026#39; + $vmName # Run the command on remote Server Invoke-VMScript -VM $VMName -ScriptType bat -ScriptText $PSText -GuestCredential $cred\nAfter the minion agent is installed on your server you need to accept the key on the salt master. From the CLI you can run these commands.\nList all keys. You should see you new minion listed in the Unaccepted Keys: salt-key -L\nAccept the new minion key on the salt master: salt-key --accept=\u0026#34;DBH-217\u0026#34;\nIf you list all keys again you should see you new minion listed in the Accepted Keys: salt-key -L\nMy next update will include information on how to auto accept new minions.\n Here are some basic salt commands from CLI that I have been using: Show all events:\nsalt-run state.event\n Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\nShow all events with a \u0026ldquo;Pretty\u0026rdquo; view:\nsalt-run state.event pretty=true\n Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\nList keys:\nsalt-key -L\nAccept Key: salt-key --accept=\u0026#34;DBH-214\u0026#34;\nDelete Key: salt-key -d \u0026#34;DBH-211,DBH-212\u0026#34;\nRun a function on one minion: salt \u0026#34;DBH-217\u0026#34; disk.usage\nRun a function on multiple minions: salt \u0026#34;DBH-217,DBH-218\u0026#34; test.ping\nRun a function on all minions: salt \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; test.ping\nCreate a file: salt \u0026#34;DBH-214\u0026#34; file.touch C:\\vCROCS\\salt.tst\nCopy a file: salt \u0026#34;DBH-214\u0026#34; cp.get_file salt://vCROCS/vCROCSTEST.ps1 \u0026#34;C:\\vCROCS\\vCROCSTEST.ps1\u0026#34;\nDelete a file: salt \u0026#34;DBH-214\u0026#34; file.remove \u0026#34;C:\\vCROCS\\vCROCSTEST.ps1\u0026#34;\nRun a PowerShell Script: salt \u0026#34;DBH-214\u0026#34; cmd.script source=\u0026#34;salt://vCROCS/vCROCSTEST.ps1\u0026#34; shell=powershell\nRestart the Salt Master Service: service salt-master restart\nShow the status of the raas and salt-master services: systemctl status raas systemctl status salt-master\nStop and start the salt-master service: systemctl stop salt-master systemctl start salt-master\nGet IP address of all minions: salt \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; network.ip_addrs\nPing All Minions: salt \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; test.ping\nDisk Space Usage on all Minions: salt \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; disk.usage\n Lessons Learned:  Anything you can do in the SaltStack Config GUI you can do in CLI. I find myself using the CLI for most testing. After I have the commands correct I will then add into the GUI. DO NOT have the minion agent version newer than the Salt-Master. I am going to try and keep the salt-master and minions always at the same version. The minion can be at an older version than the salt-master. During my upgrade from SaltStack Config 8.3 to 8.4 the Salt API did not upgrade. I didn\u0026rsquo;t remember seeing any errors in LCM after the upgrade. The raas service was at version 8.4 and the salt API was at 8.3. I had authentication issues, I could not accept keys, etc\u0026hellip; I opened an SR with VMware and they helped me fix the issue. The support I received from VMware with Salt was probably the best support I received on any VMware product.

I think this is a metric that you can show to an APP Owner and they can understand why this is important.\nCPU Ready|State (ms): \"Time that the virtual machine was ready, but could not get scheduled to run on the physical CPU during last measurement interval\" \n vCenter VM Advanced Performance: Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot \n vCenter VM Advanced Performance Settings: Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot  When I looked at vROPS OOTB (Out of the Box) the VM CPU Metric CPU|Ready (ms) was not being collected. I wanted to be able to show the CPU Metric CPU|Ready (ms) in a Right-Size/Performance Dashboard to show APP Owners this value.\nSteps to add Metric CPU|Ready (ms) to vROPS:  Administration: Policies. Select your Default Policy. Edit Policy. Select Object Type: Virtual Machine Filter for the word Ready. Expand the metrics/CPU. You will see Ready (ms) Disabled. Change State and Instanced State to Enabled. Save See the (2) screen shots below.  \n  Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\n Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\n  Here is a vROPS Dashboard that I created to show APP Owners Performance information and Right Sizing information in a \"Single Pane of Glass\". A question the APP Owners always ask is WHY should we take resources away from a VM to make the performance better. If you look at the Column CPU|Remove and then look at the column CPU|Ready (ms), the CPU|Ready (ms) is much higher on VMs that are NOT Right Sized. In one Dashboard I am showing several CPU performance metrics, vSAN performance metrics, CPU configuration (Counts/Hot ADD) and Right Sizing. I like to be able to look at all these metrics at the same time. Nice to be able to see if there is a relationship between performance, latency and Right Sizing. Does CPU performance affect the vSAN performance? Here is a VM that CPU|Remove is 0 and the CPU|Ready (ms) is much lower. Why is that? \n Dashboard Screen Shot: VM Names were removed from screen Shot\nClick Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\nClick here to Download Dashboard and Views from VMware Code Web Site\n CPU | Ready (ms) metric after using vROPS Right Size recommendation:  Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\nThis metric chart is showing a VM that had 12 CPU. vROPS recommended that the CPU count be 10. Before VM CPU count was changed to 10 you can see the CPU|Ready (ms) was running between 1500 - 2000 (ms). After the VM CPU count was changed to 10 you can see the CPU|Ready (ms) was running between 500 - 600 (ms). If you would do this across 100s of VMs in a cluster you would see even more performance gains because then the \u0026ldquo;Noisy Neighbors\u0026rdquo; would not be as Noisy.\n Performance Values:  CPU|Ready (ms) should be 1000 or less for best performance CPU|Remove - I like to keep this at 2 or less. For some applications this can be trial and error. CPU|Add - I like to keep this at 0. Make sure the VM is sized with enough resources. Don\u0026rsquo;t under size VMs. This will keep the APP Owners Happy!   The next section was in an IBM KB article that I found helpful: CPU ready time is a vSphere metric that records the amount of time a VM is ready to use CPU but was unable to schedule physical CPU time because all the vSphere ESXi host CPU resources are busy. CPU ready time is dependent on the number of VMs on the host and their CPU loads. It is normal for a VM to average between 0–50 ms of CPU ready time; anything over 1000 ms is considered to lead to VM performance problems.\nVMs that are configured with multiple vCPUs will suffer from an increased amount of ready time than compared to VMs with fewer vCPUs configured. Ready time increases as the VM needs more vCPU resources to be made available at the same time and, therefore, may have to wait for extended times for all the required vCPUS to be free to be made available to the VM with more vCPUs.\n In Addition to Right Sizing, I also think that Optimizing a VM is important. VMware has a Fling available that I like to use VMware OS Optimization Tool that helps you optimize CPU Settings.  Dashboard Tips:  Add Color to the list data to make poor performance values catch your eye. (I used Red) Use Donut Charts to show some of the metrics that you feel are more important.  To add color to List View values, use Show advanced settings for a metric:\n\n Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot Enter the metric values when you want the color to change:\n Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\nI like using Donut Charts in Dashboards. You can show a lot of data in a small amount of screen space. Using colors also catches your eye quickly when there are issues:\n Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\n When I write about Automation I always say there are many ways to accomplish the same task. Monitoring is the same way. I am showing what I felt was important to see but every organization will be different. Add/Remove columns in the Dashboard to suite you needs. There is no right or wrong way to monitor. Maybe other metrics make more sense to you. What is important with monitoring is don\u0026rsquo;t install vRealize Operation and not use it. Don\u0026rsquo;t make vROPS Shelfware! This is a GREAT Tool that shows you so much information about your virtual environment.
